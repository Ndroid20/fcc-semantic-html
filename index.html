        <h1>How I seasoned my carbon steel pan</h1>
        <h2>by: Anthony Romero-Jorge</h2>
        <h3>I recently bought a 10 inch carbon steel pan. 
        I really like this pan but it was my first time seasoning it. The season does not mean I am adding flavor to the pan it means I am creating a protective layer on the pan by burning oil at a high temperature.
        I first scrubbed off the factory wax protecting the pan. Next, I lightly rubbed the pan all over in a grapeseed oil using a paper towel.
        Then I placed the pan in a preheated oven at 400 degrees Fahrenheit for an hour. Once the hour was over I turned off the oven and let the pan cool off. 
        Now the pan has turned from a gray color to a light brown color. I will repeat this process for 4-7 times until the pan is a dark brown color. 
        It will become non-stick so when I cook eggs they will easily slide around.
